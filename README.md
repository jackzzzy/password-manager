## About
In today's digital world, there is a need for a secure way to store our passwords. Passman offers you with exactly that! With Passman, you can add, see, change, or remove your saved passwords. You can also generate a password according to your needs (whether to include uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers or special characters) and also check the strength of your passwords. The XAMPP stack was used to develop this web application.

## Why you need a password manager
Password management is a crucial tool when you have any online presence. It's vital that all of your accounts online use strong and unique passwords so that they're much more difficult to break in to. Even if one of your accounts are breached, having unique passwords means that the likelihood of the attacker gaining further access to your accounts portfolio is greatly reduced. Without a password manager, such as PassMan, it would be very tedious to manage different passwords for each service.
